# Bond
## Callable Bonds
- Many bonds have a 'call option' embedded in them
- The issuer has the right, but not the obligation to retire the debt eartly at a predetermined call price(s).
    - Typically the right can be exercised on a set of finite predetermined dates
    - The call price could be different for the different dates

## Putable Bonds
- The owner of a putable bond has the right, but not the obligation to require the issuer to pay him back early
    - Typically the right can be exercised on a set of finite predetermined dates
    - The put price could be different for the different dates
- Why/when would a bondholder want to put the bond back to the issuer?
    - If the bondholder can reinvest at a higher rate given the same level of risk.
    This can happen if either interest rates have  gone up or if the issuer's credit quality has deteriorated.
    - Bondholder needs cash back
