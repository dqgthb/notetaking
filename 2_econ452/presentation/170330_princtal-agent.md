## CEO is the agent
managing the firm

CEO income : y
effort

## CEO maximizes their expected utility
$$
E(u) = \frac{ -exp(p(u^{ 2 }/2-Y)) }{ p }  
$$

The firm generates a net renenue
$$
\epsilon _{ f } \sim  \\
R = \mu  + T \epsilon _{ f }  
$$

CEO invests some of their 
Invest \$M in market portfolio with rate of return $$ r_{ m }  $$ 

CEO income
$$
Y = b_{ 0 } + (r_{ m } -r_{ 0 } )M + b_{ 1 } R 
$$

Fixed salary + ROI + Bonus

b1 : performance whatever, refered to as commission

Stockholders choose $$b_{ 0 } and b_{ 1 } $$

Exp return
$$
E(r_{ S } ) = \frac{ (1-b_{ 1 } )\mu - b_{ 0 }  }{ t }  
$$

Investors receive dividends d

$$
d = r_{ 0 } + q(1-b_{ 1 } ) \sigma_{ fm }  
$$

Assuming you don't have voting rights?

Only if they ahve assurance that they will be paid.  + risk premium

q = market price of risk

(1-b)stuff : market /shareholder return covariance

For some industries it will be related rather than others.

This is from CAPM 

Stockholder exp profit
$$
E(n) = E(r_{ s } ) - d 
$$
## PA problem
What salary $$ b_{ 0 }  $$ and commissions $$ b_{ 1 }  $$  should the stockholders

## Incentive compatibility
$$
(\mu *, M*) = arg max_{ \mu ,M } E(U) 
$$

## Participation Constraint

$$
E(U) \gt  \mu_{ 0 } \text{ reservation utility } 
$$

## Shareholder problem
$$
max _{ b_{ 0 } b_{ 1 }  } E(N) 
$$

The optimal commission $$ b_{ 1j }  $$ 

$$
\frac{\partial  }{\partial T } b_{ 1 } \gt 0 
$$
$$
\frac{\partial  }{\partial \sigma ^{ 2 }_{ f }  } b_{ 1 } \lt 0 
$$
$$
\frac{\partial  }{\partial \sigma _{ fm }  } b_{ 0 }  =? 
$$
There is a tradeoff between CEO salary $$ b_{ 0 }  $$ and his commission.

## Variation

CEO chooses effort, his personal investments and firms investment.

## Regression
Determinants of the salary, and 
column 1 total assets variable has a lot of effect on CEO's 

PA model makes no prediction regarding the effect of beta on the pay performance 
ormance sensitivity. Effect of beta on the pay performance equation should be more negative.

## Table 5

## Evaluating the effects of exogenous Variable on Pay-Performance Sensitivity b_{ 1 }
### The effect of firm size
### The effect of increase in R&D spending
### The effect of stock beta
Depending on the effect of salaries
Generate positive b1

## Further analysis of CEO's compensation Components
- stock and stock option incentive
- Pay-related incentives

## Conclusion
- Effects on salary and bonus are of high magnitude but low statistical significance
- Several features of the findings are consistent with the model's predictions
