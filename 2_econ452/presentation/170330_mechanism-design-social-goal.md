# Mechanism Design: How to Implement Social Goals
by Eric S. Maskin

## History

## Implementing Social Goals
- achieve goal
    - distribution of goods
- How?
    - Capitalism
- Poorly built mechanism used in the decision making process
    - Freedom

## Outcomes and Optimality
- Outcome is contextual
- Optimality is contextual

## Mechanism is the dark
- difficulty for informatione
- lack of information forces the mechanism designer to generate this information

## Another spoke in the wheel
- Individuals who do have the information have their own objectives
    - incentive to lie or act
- must be incentive compatible; incentives of the designer align with the incentives of the participants

## Implementation Theory/ Incentive Compatibility
Given a goal, Predicted outcomes coinside with the desirable outcomes, according to that goal

## Theorems posited by paper
### general rule? social choice rule is implementable or not?

## Monotonocity!
Key to implementability for nash equilibrium

- if outcome alpa is optimal in state theta.
- if alpha does not fall in anyone's ranking relative to all other outcomes when going from state theta to state theta'
- then monotonicity requires that alpha also be optimal in state theta'
- all implementable mechanisms must have monotonicity property but not all mechanisms with monotonicity are implementable
- ???


### example

## Theorem 1
if a social choice rule is implementable, then it must be monotonic

### So how do we know for sure if a social choice rule is implementable?

### No veto power?
D has a veto power to change the outcome a to b which a was the best for ABC.

### IRL
- Often outcomes entail distribution of economic goods across individuals
- individuals prefer a bigger share of those goods, no two can agree on an outcome being best - both of them can't get the biggest share
- Easy to understand
  - When distributing apple,banana, orange ABCD
  - three A should get apple but ...
  - distributing one apple is perfectly divisible
  - each ranks themselves getting the maximum possible share as the best outcome
  - they are not fulfilling the condition for veto power


## If you napped and missed everything, this is all you need to know
- What is implementation theory about?
    - subfield whether it can be implementable or not
- What do you mean when you say a mechanism is implementable?
- Why did we look at that long complex example?
- What was the problem there?
- Why can't a simple just ask mechanism work?
- So what was the mechanism that was implementable and why?
- Given any mechanism ever, how do we know if it's implimentable
    - Monotonic?
    - Veto power?
