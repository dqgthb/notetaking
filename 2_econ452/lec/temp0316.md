App:
- exchange economy
- surplus sharing problems
- many more, including the two-sided matching market (we shall study)

Looking for (xp,xs,xd)

$$
x_{ P } + x_{ S } + x_{ D } = 1000 
$$

$$
x_{ P } \geq 500; x_{ S } \geq 300; x_{ D } \geq 0\\
x_{ P } + x_{ S } \geq 600; x_{ P } +x_{ D } \geq  550; x_{ S } + x_{ D } \geq  400\\
$$

Don't have the incentive to leave.
For the entire set of agents, that number can achieve a high utility for all the members.

## Two-sided matching market
market with agents that can be partitioned to two disjoint sets: men and women, firms and workers, medical interns and hospitals, etc.

Allocation how to match one side of the agent to the other side. 

Subset clear division, you end of a large of nice results.

_Preference relation of _

_Each firm here has only a single position._

## One-to-one, two-sided

$ u_{ i }  $ is the utility function of agent i $ \in F \cup W $ such that
$$
u_{ f } : W \cup \left\{ f \right\} \Longrightarrow R\: \text{for all }  
$$

## matching
A matching is a function $ \mu : F \cup W \Longrightarrow F \cup W $ such that 

- for all $ f \in F, \mu (f) \in W \cup \left\{ f \right\} \Longrightarrow $ each firm is matched to (at most) one worker
- for all $ w \in W, \mu (w) \in F \cup \left\{ w \right\} \Longrightarrow  $ each worker is matched to (at most) one firm.
- for all $ i,j \in F \cup W $, if $ \mu (i) = j $, then $ \mu (j) = i -> $ if i is matched to j, j is matched to i.

## Stable Matching
- if $ j !\prec_{ i }  i $ then we say that j is acceptable to i.
- A matching $ mu $ is individually rational if $ \mu \left( i \right)  $ is acceptable to every $ i \in F \cup W $ 

Assume F3 is matched to w3
$$
\mu \left( f_{ 3 }  \right) = w_{ 3 }  
$$
$$
\mu \left( w_{ 2 }  \right) = f_{ 3 }  
$$

If there is a blocking pair, they prefered to be matched compared with his current partner. 
- A match is stable if it is individually rational and there is no **blocking pair**.
