## Why is the creation and use of the euro considered to be such a great accomplishment? Was it needed? What were the goals policy makers wanted to achieve with a monetary union?

- clout (borrow in their own currency)
- liquidity
- Helps trade -> one currency -> no uncertainty -> no competitive devaluations -> inflation low
- Increase price transparency -> market efficiency
- Eliminates transection costs

## In your opinion is Europe an Optimal Currency Area?
