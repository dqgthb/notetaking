If you want to change GBP to USD,

you don't want your GBP to be undervalued compared with USD.
Then, GBP/USD must be higher (one GBP would cost more USD).

dollar/pound (in the lecture notation) must be higher.

So you buy a put option of GBP/USD to hedge.

If GBP/USD goes down, you lose your money but it can be compensated by option.

If USD/GBP goes up, you gain money but you should pay some fixed premium about the cost of call.

Hedge successful.
